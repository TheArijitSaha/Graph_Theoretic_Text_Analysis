KOLKATA: The battle for Bengal's 42 seats is proving one of the toughest this election, with the BJP aiming for 23 seats and chief minister Mamata Banerjee determined not to cede any. This is the most polarised election the state has seen, where the bulk of sparring has been between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mamata Banerjee. The BJP, however, has left nothing to chance. Party chief Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath have also campaigned regularly in the state.
Traditionally, the BJP has a minimal presence in Bengal, where the main battle initially was between the Congress and the Left - which ruled the state for 35 years - and later, the Trinamool and the Left. Over the last few years, the BJP has carved out a political space larger than the Congress and the Left, though in terms of seats, it has just two from the state in the Lok Sabha and three in the assembly.

Between 1996 and 2014, The Trinamool and the Congress have swapped places in terms of vote share, shows data from previous elections. In 1996, the Congress had 40 per cent of the votes in the state. In the 2014 election, it was the Trinamool that had 40 per cent of the votes and the Congress was reduced to 10 per cent.
